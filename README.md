# MnoFrontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.3.

Before contributing Maestrano product refactorings this project library, please read [this](https://angular.io/guide/creating-libraries#refactoring-parts-of-an-app-into-a-library).

**All `ng` commands are applied to the default project mno-frontend-lib. To apply to a different project, add the project flag, e.g `--project mno-frontend-app`.**

## Development server

For the first time, run a `ng build` to build the mno-frontend-lib project, or `ng build --watch` for live build updates.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Distribution

Run `npm run package` to prepare for NPM distribution (runs build & creates a tarball zip).
